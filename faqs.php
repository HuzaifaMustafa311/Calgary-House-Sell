              This is a great question and one of the Calgary Home Sale’ frequently asked questions we see. The answer
              to this depends on the inspection and approval process. If your house meets our criteria, we can provide
              you with a cash offer for your home. Normally, we can have this paid out within seven days. After we buy
              the home, we have a team come in to make repairs if needed. However, if you have the time to wait for
              30-90 days, we can list your house on MLS. This would be a more traditional route that you’re used to
              seeing with a realty company.

              We strive to provide our clients with the fairest cash price possible. Keep in mind that our final offer
              depends on a few different factors. When we conduct a walkthrough of your home, we note the house’s
              condition, the house’s age, and a few other routine elements.

              <strong>Calgary Home Sale frequently asked questions on fees are best answered like this:</strong>
            <p>If pay cash for your home, there are zero fees to pay on your part. This means you pay nothing for
              repairs, closing costs, and fees, and zero commission deducted from your final sale price.</p>
            <p>In situations where we have a separate investor make an offer on the property, we still ensure that you
              still get treated fairly. The investor purchases the house, and we get your cash to you nothing else to
              worry about as the investor pays us a fee. It’s that easy.</p>
            <p>Sometimes clients decide to list the house because they have 30-90 days to wait for offers to come in. In
              this case these prices range from a flat fee to a percentage.</p>

              There are many things that set us apart from a traditional agents. For starters, when we buy, we don’t
              charge any fees or commission. You will never have to pay for any repairs when we make you a cash offer
              because our team handles that as well. Once you accept our offer, it’s also up to you to decide the
              closing date.
